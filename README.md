# **Birthday Wisher**

## About
A `Birthday Wisher` application developed in Python. It reads birthday data from a `birthdays.csv` file and checks if today is someone's birthday. If there is a match, it sends a birthday greeting email to the birthday person. The greeting is randomly selected from one of the letters in the `letter_templates` directory.

The configuration details, such as email, password, smtp server, smptp port and letters, are stored in the `config.py` file, which needs to be updated. The birthday list in the `birthdays.csv` file also needs to be updated for the application to work correctly.

Schedule executing this Python module in the cloud to completely automate sending birthday greetings.
